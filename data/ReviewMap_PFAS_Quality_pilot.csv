as Category 1 endocrine disruptors with high concern in terms of
human or wildlife exposure (McCarthy, 2011). Category 1 compounds
are defined as chemicals where at least one study has shown endocrine
effects in an intact organism. The EU report lists 60 Category 1 substances
(29 chemical groups) that are highly persistent or have high
current production volume (McCarthy, 2011). In addition we include
the polyfluorinated chemicals, a group of ubiquitous biopersistent
emerging endocrine disruptors (White et al., 2011) that are receiving
increasing attention. Table I lists the specific chemical substances with
abbreviations that are referenced in the text and in Tables II–VII.
(2) Outcomes: Cryptorchidism (one or both testicles undescended)
ascertained at birth or during childhood, hypospadias, testicular cancer
regardless of histological subgroup, and sperm count (number of
spermatozoa per volume or mass unit of seminal fluid).
(3) Exposure to specific chemicals in utero or in the first year of life (postnatal
exposure) documented by measurements in biological specimens (maternal blood or urine, placenta or fat tissue as well as amnion fluid, cord blood or breast milk). In addition serum concentrations in adult life as proxies for fetal or early life exposure were
also included for testicular cancer.
(4) Outcome ascertainment by medical standardized examination or
antecedent medical records or reporting to health registries.
(5) Risk estimates (rate risk [RR], OR, hazard ratio [HR]) for an outcome
according to higher versus lower levels of prenatal and postnatal
exposure defined by exposure contrasts within the given study.
Studies reporting alternative measures of association such as difference
in mean values of exposure levels in cases and controls were
also included, and the authors were contacted to get risk estimates
(Hosie et al., 2000; Damgaard et al., 2006; Main et al., 2007;
Choi et al., 2012; Fenichel et al., 2012; Komarowska et al., 2015;

excluded studies with blood sampling after the diagnosis of testicular cancer;

excluding the studies one at a time; (iv) performed separate analyses of
studies with high completeness of reporting and lower risk of bias and
confounding as defined above; and (v) performed separate analyses of
large case-referent studies with at least 75 cases.
We computed a common risk estimate across studies by weighing
the risk ratio (RR) or equivalent (OR or HR) by the inverse variance
computed from the mean of the provided confidence limits. This is justified
because the outcomes are rare (prevalence <5%). Random effects
estimates are presented regardless of tests for heterogeneity since all
studies are conceptually heterogeneous. Nevertheless we also provide
I2 statistics as a formal measure of heterogeneity. Bootstrapping techniques
were used in analyses where the same study yielded more than
one risk estimate, to account for multiple risk estimates per person in
studies where risk estimates were reported for several compounds or
outcomes. Bootstrapping with 500 repeats was applied by sampling
among all included risk estimates, ensuring that each study only contributed
one risk estimate to each bootstrapping step. Mean values across
bootstrapped steps were used as overall measures of common risk estimates
and confidence limits. These analyses were repeated for each
outcome to account for heterogeneity in the exposure–outcome
relation.'",1 = “Yes” = included only low risk of bias studies OR the authors performed analyses to investigate possible impact of RoB on summary estimates of effect.,"Risk of bias across studies was evaluated by means of funnel plots to

models rather than fixed effects models in all analyses. In spite of
strong heterogeneity across studies with respect to study populations,
exposures and outcomes, it is remarkable that all summary risk
